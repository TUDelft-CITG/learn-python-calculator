# `TUDelft-CiTG/learn-python` Online Python Calculator

This repository provides the "online calculator" for [this Python course]([https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/learn-python](https://tudelft-citg.github.io/learn-python/intro.html)). It was built in June 2023 for the new version for the summer using the template repository at [JupyterLite Demo](https://github.com/jupyterlite/demo). It uses a Pyodide kernel. At this time only the REPL feature is used, combined with a PyPI package for checking answers to the exercises.

See the [course repo](https://github.com/TUDelft-CITG/learn-python) for more information.
